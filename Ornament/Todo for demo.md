### immediates
- [ ] add enemy-to-enemy pushback to prevent enemies stacking on top of eachother
- [ ] rework stun & knockback, component-ize hurtboxes

### Six enemy types
- [ ] [Sewer rat] (big and large reskins)
	- tutorial enemy for grounded combat
- [ ] [bat]
	- tutorial enemy for aerial combat
- [ ] [Giant toad]
	-  belches slow moving poison bubbles towards player
	-  will try to hop over players head when they get too close
- [ ] [enchanted block]
	- simple enemy-as-platform
	- attacks with short ranged burst out of central "eye"
	- cannot be killed, but can be knocked around and jumped on to get to high ledges
- [ ] [flying enchanted block]
	- basically just a bat but with a dive attack
	- main purpose is to be used in [gate] fight, but need to also introduce them beforehand
- [ ] [enchanted construct]
	-  group of enchanted blocks fused together
	-  big lumbering attacks
	-  breaks into [enchanted block]s when killed (maybe some become flying)
- [ ] [enchanted sentinel]
	-  more elite enchanted stone warrior
	-  magical blade and shield, similar to HK moss knight
- [ ] [gate] - demo boss
	-  magical stone infused with life, tasked with barring passage
		-  1st phase: deal as many hits as possible to central console while avoiding lair attacks such as:
		-  floor/ceiling coming together to crush you
		-  pits opening up
		-  [flying enchanted block]s being spawned
		- 2nd phase: console transforms into [gate's aegis], big knight with a massive shield
		- shield is swung in huge attacks
		- shield can shoot a beam out of the front
		- mobility options like melding into the floor / dropping out of the ceiling etc


### Player mechanics
- [ ] upwards grounded attack
	- [ ] like you lean your head to one side and maybe a spike of [Wreath] juts out into the air above you
	- are players going to be able to run while up attacking? probably not which isnt a huge deal because i plan on making short-hop-up-attacking the more viable option against aerial enemies
- [ ] aerial attacks
	- [ ] side - slashing swipe, with decent reach but longish cd because i plan on making aerial enemies decently mobile.
	- [ ] up -
